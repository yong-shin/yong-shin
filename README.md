### üéì Education
  - üá∞üá∑ 08.2020 ~ : Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, [Interactive Computing Lab](https://http://ic.kaist.ac.kr/wiki/wiki.cgi?Main/)(Department of Knowledge Service Engineering)
    - M.S. Student
  - üá∞üá∑ 03.2013 ~ 12. 2019 : Handong Global University
    - B.A. in Mathematics and Statistics


### üíª Project
  - Deepbrain AI | Video & Speech synthesis (09.2021 ~ 11.2021)
    -  We produced AI Human through voice conversion using StarGAN and image synthesis using FSGAN. We improved voice synthesis performance by utilizing various sampling rates, batch size, and iteration, and improved image synthesis performance by utilizing average similarity between videos.

    - [Demo video](https://yong-shin.github.io/assets/Video/Demo%20video.mp4)
  - KAIST | Digital Therapeutics(DTx) (08.2020 ~ 09.2021)
    -  We develop fundamental technologies of data-driven digital therapeutic, receptivity optimization for mobile digital therapeutic development. Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of digital treatments by applying causal analysis.

  - KAIST | Smart Mask (10.2020 ~ )
    -  We review existing types of smart masks and study what sensor data can be collected through smart masks. Also, we develop emotional and stress monitoring algorithms through smart mask sensor data.
  - KAIST | Contact Tracing (08.2020 ~ 12.2020)
    -  We develop risk scoring algorithms that can be used for analysis to detect BLE contact between client devices. In addition, the need to introduce a place beacon is increasing as the number of cases infected with COVID increases just by staying in the same place without having to contact the confirmed patient directly. We also identify the coverage that place beacon can effectively send and receive signals with client devices.
