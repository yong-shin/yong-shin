### üíª  Project
  - KAIST | Emotion Recognition (10.2021 ~ 07.2022)
    -  In this study, we propose a method for predicting the emotions of the speaker in the naturalistic conversation using a speaker encoder and counterpart encoder composed of CNN-LSTM deep learning networks. We used emotion-related data called K-EmoCon collected during the debate process to empirically evaluate our model. The results showed that the counterpart‚Äôs speech and the physiological signals had a positive impact on predicting the speaker‚Äôs emotions.

  - Deepbrain AI | Video & Speech synthesis (09.2021 ~ 11.2021)
    -  We produced AI Human through voice conversion using StarGAN and image synthesis using FSGAN. We improved voice synthesis performance by utilizing various sampling rates, batch size, and iteration, and improved image synthesis performance by utilizing average similarity between videos.

  - KAIST | Smart Mask (10.2020 ~ )
    -  We review existing types of smart masks and study what sensor data can be collected through smart masks. Also, we develop emotional and stress monitoring algorithms through smart mask sensor data.
  - KAIST | Contact Tracing (08.2020 ~ 12.2020)
    -  We develop risk scoring algorithms that can be used for analysis to detect BLE contact between client devices. In addition, the need to introduce a place beacon is increasing as the number of cases infected with COVID increases just by staying in the same place without having to contact the confirmed patient directly. We also identify the coverage that place beacon can effectively send and receive signals with client devices.
